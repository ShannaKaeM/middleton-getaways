## Migration Notes

### Migrating from Hardcoded Values
1. Identify all hardcoded design values in templates
2. Create corresponding tokens in primitive JSON files
3. Replace hardcoded values with primitive book includes
4. Test thoroughly across all templates

### Migrating from Previous Design Systems
1. Map existing design tokens to Design Book structure
2. Import values into appropriate JSON files
3. Update template references to use new primitive books
4. Verify CSS variable generation
5. Test visual consistency
